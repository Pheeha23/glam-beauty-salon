# Salon Site Practice
This was a website that I built using only html and css.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML and CSS

This website was a way for me to master the box model. I used only floats as opposed to the regular flex-box that everyone knows and loves. The Lookbook section was especially difficult, but the lessons I learned from building it extend far beyond this simple website.


## Optimizations

If I had a bit more time to sink into this side project, I would have like to make the slanted photo at the top less pixelated. I used only CSS linear-gradient to create the effect of a slanted photo and border-radius to create the neat curve on the right. However, the paint on these effects aren't the cleanest methods. 

## Lessons Learned:

FLOATS!!! I challenge anyone seeing this page to try it out. The amount of knowledge that you will gain from working with floats really deepens the understanding you have of the box model. The relationship between different elements on the page is forced into a symbiotic relationship with clearfix and border-box.
